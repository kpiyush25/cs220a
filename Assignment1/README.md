## Information/Assumption about our implementation :

### Q1 
To run the simulation write `iverilog A1Q1_eight_bit_adder_top.v` in 
terminal and then `./a.out` in the terminal to get the output.

### Q2
To run the simulation write `iverilog A1Q1_eight_bit_comparator_top.v` in 
terminal and then `./a.out` in the terminal to get the output.
